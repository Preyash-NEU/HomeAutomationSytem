# Home Automation System

This project is a comprehensive Home Automation System that integrates multiple design patterns to provide a robust, scalable, and modular architecture. The system manages smart devices such as lights, air conditioners, and security features, enabling different user roles to interact seamlessly with these devices.


## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Adapter Design Pattern
- **Purpose**: The `EnvironmentAdapter` adapts the environmental configuration to match the specific requirements of each room type. For example, in a bedroom, the blinds are set to 100%, while in a living room, they are set to 50%.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Flexibility**: Easily switch environments between rooms without modifying room-specific code.
  - **Extensibility**: New room types or environments can be added with minimal changes.
  - **Modularity**: Centralized adaptation logic keeps room classes clean.

### 2. Bridge Pattern
- **Purpose**: Decouples an abstraction (user roles like Family, Guest, and Stranger) from its implementation (security features) so both can vary independently.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Flexibility**: Easily modify security features for different user roles.
  - **Independence**: Separates role-specific logic from security implementations.
  - **Scalability**: New roles or security features can be added without impacting existing code.

### 3. Builder Pattern
- **Purpose**: Simplifies the creation of complex objects, like an `Environment`, by constructing them step-by-step.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Clarity**: Improves code readability by providing a clear way to create objects.
  - **Immutability**: Constructed `Environment` objects are immutable.
  - **Customization**: Allows for easy customization without affecting the overall construction process.

### 4. Command Design Pattern
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates a request as an object, enabling parameterization, queuing, and logging.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Decoupling**: Separates invoker from the object performing the operation.
  - **Extensibility**: Easily add new commands.
  - **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Simplifies implementing undo/redo by storing command history.

### 5. Composite Pattern
- **Purpose**: Treats individual devices and groups of devices uniformly, allowing for hierarchical structures.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Uniformity**: Simplifies client interaction by treating individual devices and groups consistently.
  - **Scalability**: Easily manage groups of devices.
  - **Flexibility**: Supports dynamic composition of devices.

### 6. Decorator Pattern
- **Purpose**: Allows for the dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Flexibility**: Add or combine features at runtime.
  - **Reusability**: Decorators can be reused across different objects.
  - **Scalability**: Extend features by layering multiple decorators.

### 7. Observer and Facade Pattern
- **Observer Pattern**:
  - **Purpose**: Establishes a one-to-many relationship for automatic updates.
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Decoupling**: Separates logic of sensors from notifications.
    - **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate observer updates ensure responsive behavior.
    - **Scalability**: Easily attach or detach observers.
- **Facade Pattern**:
  - Used for providing a simplified interface to the complex subsystem involving multiple smart home components.

### 8. Prototype Pattern
- **Purpose**: Enables creation of new objects by copying existing ones.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces object creation cost.
  - **Consistency**: Cloned objects maintain consistent structure.
  - **Flexibility**: Simplifies the creation of similar objects.

### 9. Factory Pattern
- **Purpose**: Provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter object types.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Centralizes object creation in factory classes.
  - **Flexibility**: Easily extend object types.
  - **Singleton Implementation**: Combines with Singleton pattern for efficient resource management.

### 10. State Pattern
- **Purpose**: Allows objects to change behavior dynamically based on state changes.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Behavioral Flexibility**: Dynamically change behavior.
  - **Encapsulation**: State-specific behaviors are encapsulated within classes.
  - **Extensibility**: Add new states without modifying existing classes.

### 11. Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one and making them interchangeable.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Flexibility**: Select and swap strategies at runtime.
  - **Encapsulation**: Keeps each strategy focused and separate.
  - **Reusability**: Strategies can be reused across contexts.

## UI for Home Automation
The project includes a user interface that enables easy interaction with the smart devices. Applied learning from software architecture lectures and independent research was used to design a modular UI.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Integration of Design Patterns**: Gained foundational understanding and successfully implemented multiple design patterns to enhance the modularity, flexibility, and scalability of the system.
- **Practical Implementation**: Developed a robust system architecture using real-world use cases for design patterns.
- **Critical Thinking**: Analyzed and selected appropriate design patterns to meet the specific requirements of the home automation project.

## Future Enhancements
- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Implement adaptive selection mechanisms for different strategies.
- **Expanded Strategy Library**: Add more strategies to cover additional use-cases.
- **Real-Time Strategy Adjustment**: Allow strategies to be adjusted dynamically based on user preferences or environmental changes.
